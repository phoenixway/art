The rain  
Will wash away our pain  
And we  
Will never be the same  
We'll fight until we live  
We'll fight until last breath  

The rain  
Will wash away the fate!  
And we all  
Forever remain!  
We'll fight until we live  
We will forever live!  
We'll fight  
Until  
We  
Wiiiin!!!  

The rain will
