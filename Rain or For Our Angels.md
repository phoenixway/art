The rain  
Will wash away our pain  
And we  
Will never be the same  

When the time stops running out  
And my hands are cold as ice  
My light'll shine  
From your hearts!  
Despite evil, fears and lies  

The rain  
Will wash away our pain  
And we  
Will never be the same  
We'll fight until we live  
We'll fight until we breathe  

And when our time will comes   
Dont be afraid of anything  
We're warriors of Light  
Forever fighting death  
We'll live in all great, kind and free!    

The rain  
Will wash away our pain  
And we  
Will never be the same  
We'll fight until we live  
We'll fight until we breathe 

And when your time is running out  
When you have no streght to carry on  
Remember you hold the light of all us  
You fight this battle with all us  
And burn down darksness for us all!!  

The rain  
Will wash away the fate!  
And we all forever remain!  
We'll fight until we live  
We'll fight until we breathe  
We'll fight  
Until  
We  
Wiiiin!!!
