The rain  
Will wash away our pain  
And we  
Will never be the same  
We'll fight until we live  
We'll fight until last breath  

And when your time is running out  
And when you have no streght to carry on  
Remember you hold the light of all us  
You fight this battle with all us  
And burn down darksness for us all!!  

The rain  
Will wash away the fate!  
And we all forever remain!  
We'll fight until we live  
We will forever live!  
We'll fight  
Until  
We  
Wiiiin!!!
