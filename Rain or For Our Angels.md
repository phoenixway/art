When the time stops running out  
And my hands are cold as ice  
My light'll shine from your hearts!  
Despite evil, fears and lies  

The rain  
Will wash away our pain  
And we  
Will never be the same  
We'll fight 'til we breathe  
We'll fight until we live  

And when our time will comes   
Dont be afraid of anything  
Warriors of Light forever fighting death!  
We'll live in all great, kind and free   

The rain  
Will wash away our pain  
And we  
Will never be the same  
We'll fight 'til we breathe  
We'll fight until we live  

When your life is running out  
When you have no streght to carry on  
Remember 
You hold the light of all us  
You fight this battle with all us  
And burn down darksness for us all!!  

The rain  
Will wash away the fate!  
And we all forever remain!  
We'll fight until we live  
We'll fight until we breathe  
We'll fight  
Until  
We  
Wiiiin!!!
